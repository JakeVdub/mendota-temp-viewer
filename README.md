# Welcome to the Mendota Temp Viewer
This project's goal is to create a high-quality web interface to view Lake Mendota temperature information over the past 24 hours. This information will be retrieved from the API provided by the UW-Madison Limnology department.

Intially, I will probably focus on displaying just the surface temperature data in a nice graph. From there, I would like to include multiple lines plotted on the same graph for the various depths that data is available for. As a stretch goal, I would like to add a second graph that plots the barometric pressure over the last 24 hours.

## Why?
The reason I am pursuing this project is because I am an avid fisherman, and water temperature along with barometric pressure play a big part in influencing fish behavior. The prudent fisherman would base their plan of attack off of recent data, so providing a 24 hour graph could allow for analyzing short term trends and adapting presentations accordingly.
